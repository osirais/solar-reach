        At Solar Reach, we are a team of passionate high school students
        committed to making a positive impact on communities with limited access
        to electricity.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, our mission is to develop and
        distribute solar-powered lights to communities with limited electricity
        access. We believe that everyone deserves the chance to thrive, study,
        and live safelyâ€”regardless of their access to the electrical grid.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our initiative is simple yet powerful: we design, build, and distribute
        solar-powered lights that offer reliable illumination to underserved
        regions. Through this effort, we aim to support education, enhance
        safety, and contribute to environmental sustainability by utilizing
        renewable energy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Driven by a shared vision of a brighter future, we are proud to play a
        role in bringing light to the places that need it most.
